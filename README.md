# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project shows how to detect faces in real-time using Python and OpenCV. The program uses your computer's camera to find faces and draw rectangles around them.

>Before running, make sure you have `Python 3.x` installed on your machine

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kimkorngmao/FaceDetection.git
   cd FaceDetection
   ```

2. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Press `q` to close the camera.

## Notes

- Make sure your camera is working before running the program.
- The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file must be in the same folder as the script.
